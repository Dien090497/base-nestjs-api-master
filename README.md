## NestJS Starter Kit

This starter kit has the following outline:

- Monolithic Project.
- REST API

This is a Github Template Repository, so it can be easily [used as a starter template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for other repositories.

## Starter kit Features

One of our main principals has been to keep the starter kit as lightweight as possible. With that in mind, here are some of the features that we have added in this starter kit.

| Feature                  | Info               | Progress |

| Authorization            | RBAC (Role based)  | Done     |
| ORM Integration          | TypeORM            | Done     |
| DB Migrations            | TypeORM            | Done     |
| Logging                  | winston            | Done     |
| Request Validation       | class-validator    | Done     |

## Installation

Note: when using docker, all the `npm` commands can also be performed using `./scripts/npm` (for example `./scripts/npm install`).
This script allows you to run the same commands inside the same environment and versions than the service, without relying on what is installed on the host.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Create a `.env` file from the template `.env.template` file.

Generate public and private key pair for jwt authentication:

### With docker

Run this command:
```bash
./scripts/generate-jwt-keys
```

It will output something like this. You only need to add it to your `.env` file.
```
To setup the JWT keys, please add the following values to your .env file:
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64="(long base64 content)"
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64="(long base64 content)"
```

### Without docker

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f jwtRS256.key
# Don't add passphrase
$ openssl rsa -in jwtRS256.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwtRS256.key.pub
```

You may save these key files in `./local` directory as it is ignored in git.

Encode keys to base64:

```bash
$ base64 -i local/jwtRS256.key

$ base64 -i local/jwtRS256.key.pub
```

Must enter the base64 of the key files in `.env`:

```bash
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64=BASE64_OF_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64=BASE64_OF_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Running the app

We can run the project with or without docker.

### Local

To run the server without Docker we need this pre-requisite:

- MySQL server running

Commands:

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

### Docker

```bash
# build image
$ docker build -t my-app .

# run container from image
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --volume 'pwd':/usr/src/app --network --env-file .env my-app

# run using docker compose
$ docker compose up
```

Apple M1 users please append `MYSQL_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` to your `.env` file. This is a workaround as MySQL docker images still doesn't support arm64 operating systems.

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Migrations

```bash
# generate migration (replace CreateUsers with name of the migration)
$ npm run migration:generate -- -n CreateUsers

# run migration
$ npm run migration:run

# revert migration
$ npm run migration:revert
```
